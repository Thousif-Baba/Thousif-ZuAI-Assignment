1. Accessing the Application

Alright, so to get started, you can access the application by simply opening your web browser and going to:

https://thousif-zuai-assignment.onrender.com

This is the main URL where the application is hosted. Just type that into your browser's address bar, and you'll be taken straight to the homepage.

2. Navigating the Home Page

When you first land on the homepage, you'll see a list of all the blog posts that have been created so far. Each post is listed with its title and a brief snippet of the content.

- Viewing a Post: If you want to read more about any post, just click on the title. This will take you to a page where you can see the full content of that particular post.

- Creating a New Post: If you’re in the mood to add something new, there’s a button labeled "Create New Post" on homepage. Just click on that, and you’ll be able to add your own blog post.

3. Creating a New Blog Post

So, when you click on "Create New Post", you’ll be taken to a form where you can add your new post.

Here’s how it works:

- Title: First, enter the title of your post. This is what will appear in the list on the homepage.
- Content: Next, write the content of your post. This is where you can express all your thoughts and ideas.
- Submit: Once you’ve filled out the title and content, just hit the "Submit" button.

Important: If you leave the title or content blank and try to submit, you’ll get an error message telling you that these fields are required. So make sure both fields are filled out before submitting.

4. Viewing and Reading Blog Posts

To read a full blog post:

- Click on the Title: On the homepage, just click on the title of any post that interests you.
- Full View: This will take you to a new page where you can read the entire post in detail.

5. Editing a Blog Post

If you need to make changes to an existing post:

- Find the Post: On the homepage, locate the post you want to edit.
- Click Edit: There’s an "Edit" button next to each post. Click that, and you’ll be taken to a form where you can make changes.
- Update the Post: Just like when you’re creating a new post, you’ll need to make sure both the title and content fields are filled out. After making your changes, click "Update" to save them.

6. Deleting a Blog Post

If you decide that a post needs to be removed:

- Find the Post: Go to the homepage and locate the post you want to delete.
- Click Delete: Next to the "Edit" button, you’ll find a "Delete" button. Clicking this will immediately remove the post from the list.

Note: Deleting a post is permanent, so be sure you really want to delete it before clicking that button.

7. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, here are a few things to check:

- Page Not Found: If you get a 404 error, double-check the URL or make sure the post you’re trying to access hasn’t been deleted.
- Slow Loading: Sometimes the app might load a bit slowly due to network issues or server load. If that happens, just try refreshing the page.
